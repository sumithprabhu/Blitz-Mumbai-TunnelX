# 🌐 TunnelX

## 🔍 What is TunnelX?
TunnelX is a **decentralized bandwidth-sharing VPN network** built on the **Monad network**, enabling users to securely access the internet through distributed nodes while allowing node providers to earn by sharing their network capacity.  
It replaces centralized VPN servers with community-operated nodes — ensuring privacy, transparency, and scalability.

---

## ⚙️ Why on Monad?
Monad provides the **ideal infrastructure** for TunnelX due to its:
- **High throughput and parallel execution**, essential for handling multiple concurrent VPN connections.
- **Low gas fees**, allowing seamless microtransactions between users and node providers.
- **Native EVM compatibility**, enabling easy contract deployment and upgrades.
- **Deterministic execution**, ensuring consistent network performance across all regions.

## High-Level Architecture & Lifecycle

### 1️⃣ Node Providers
Individuals or organizations can register nodes by:
- Staking a minimum amount of MON tokens.
- Declaring their **region**, **bandwidth capacity (Mbps)**, and **price per GB**.
- Running the **TunnelX Node Runner** (a lightweight client handling VPN tunnels & traffic accounting).

Once registered, nodes become discoverable by users via the TunnelX dashboard.

### 2️⃣ Users
Users interact through the frontend where they can:
- Connect wallets (via RainbowKit).
- View available regions and node stats (bandwidth, uptime, price).
- Choose a region, top up their in-app wallet, and start tunneling traffic.

The system automatically debits usage fees based on MB consumed.

### 3️⃣ Smart Contracts
Deployed Contract: https://testnet.monadexplorer.com/address/0x8d16084D0BD8cC3d1BD2d44fAce8CA7B6E09Ef70


Contracts handle:
- Node registration and staking
- Session management and data usage tracking
- Automatic fee distribution to node providers
- Governance functions (e.g., slashing and reputation scoring)

### 4️⃣ Backend
Handles off-chain logic:
- API routes for node registration, usage recording, and connection setup
- Dynamic WireGuard config generation for VPN sessions
- Peer synchronization between users and node providers

### 5️⃣ Node Runner
A standalone script that:
- Registers itself with the backend
- Runs a local WireGuard server for tunneling
- Tracks usage and reports back to the smart contract/backend
- Can be installed on any system with WireGuard support

### 6️⃣ Lifecycle Flow
```
User Connects → Selects Region → Backend Generates Config →
Node Runner Accepts Peer → Tunnel Established → Usage Recorded →
Smart Contract Updates State → Provider Paid Automatically
```

## 🧩 Future Scope & DAO Mechanism

- **DAO Governance:** Community-based decision-making for network rules, parameters, and upgrades.
- **Slashing Mechanism:** Nodes that fail uptime, leak data, or cheat on accounting will have their stake slashed.

## 💎 Benefits

### 1️⃣ Decentralized & Distributed
Removes the dependency on centralized VPN providers — users connect directly through community nodes.

### 2️⃣ Earn by Contributing
Anyone can participate as a node runner, offering bandwidth and earning MON tokens in return.

### 3️⃣ Privacy-Preserving Architecture
End-to-end encrypted tunnels, minimal metadata exposure, and on-chain transparency.

### 4️⃣ Community Governance
A DAO ensures fair participation, transparent rewards, and collective upgrades.

### 5️⃣ Scalable & Affordable
The hybrid model (on-chain + off-chain) ensures performance at scale while keeping usage fees negligible.
